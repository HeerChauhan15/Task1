# Task1
**Name**: Heer Chauhan <br>
**Company**: CODTECH IT SOLULTIONS <br>
**ID**: CT04DF2995 <br>
**DOMAIN**: DATA ANALYTICS <br>
**DURATION**: 5TH JUNE TO 5TH JULY 2025 <br>


**Objective**
The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive big data analysis on a large dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis involves data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and applying suitable big data tools to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of the data efficiently. This project aims to demonstrate the use of big data techniques and frameworks to derive actionable business or research insights.

**Programming Language**
Python (with libraries such as Pandas, PySpark, and Matplotlib)

Apache Spark (via PySpark) for distributed data processing and scalability

## Description
This project involves working with a large dataset to demonstrate big data handling and analysis techniques. The steps include:
- Data loading and cleaning
